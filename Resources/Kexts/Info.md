Please place all kernel extensions (kexts) required for your hardware into this folder.  Make sure "FakeSMC.kext" is located there at the very minimum, as it is ESSENTIAL to having a bootable system.

You can find FakeSMC.kext bundled with the HWSensors at https://github.com/kozlek/HWSensors or http://sourceforge.net/projects/hwsensors/
